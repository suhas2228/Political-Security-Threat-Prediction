Stacking Classifier

9. Training the model
10. Building the model 
11. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
12. Importing the packages
13. User gives input 
14. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
15. Trained model is used for prediction 
16. Along with that we Applied LDA model for Topic Modelling
17. Final outcome is displayed through frontend

Dataset

Extension
========
In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different Machine Learning models with Lexicon Approach using DT, SVM and Naive Bayes got 69% of accuracy, 
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier and Stacking Classifier may get 90%  of accuracy or above, 
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
